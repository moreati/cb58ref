cb58ref is a reference implementation of the CB58 encoding used by `AVA`_.
CB58 is similar to the `Base58Check`_ encoding used in Bitcoin

* both can encode arbitrary an arbitrary byte sequence
* both use the same alphabet
* both append a 4 byte checksum

they differ in the following respects

* CB58 uses the final 4 bytes of ``SHA256(msg)`` as the checksum.
  Base58Check uses the first 4 bytes of ``SHA256(SHA256(msg))`` as the
  checksum.
